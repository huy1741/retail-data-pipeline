# retail-data-pipeline

Walmart is the biggest retail store in the United States. Just like others, they have been expanding their e-commerce part of the business. By the end of 2022, e-commerce represented a roaring $80 billion in sales, which is 13% of total sales of Walmart. One of the main factors that affects their sales is public holidays, like the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. 

In this project, you have been tasked with creating a data pipeline for the analysis of demand and supply around the holidays and running preliminary analysis of the data. You will be working with two data sources: grocery sales and complementary data. You have been provided with the `grocery_sales` table in `PostgreSQL` database and `extra_data.parquet` file that contains complementary data. 

Here is information about all the available columns in the two data files:
- `"index"` - unique ID of the row
- `"Store_ID"` - the store number
- `"Date"` - the week of sales
- `"Weekly_Sales"` - sales for the given store
- `"IsHoliday"` - Whether the week contains a public holiday - 1 if yes, 0 if no.
- `"Temperature"` - Temperature on the day of sale
- `"Fuel_Price"` - Cost of fuel in the region
- `"CPI"` – Prevailing consumer price index
- `"Unemployment"` - The prevailing unemployment rate
- `"MarkDown1"`, `"MarkDown2"`, `"MarkDown3"`, `"MarkDown4"` - number of promotional markdowns
- `"Dept"` - Department Number in each store
- `"Size"` - size of the store
- `"Type"` - type of the store (depends on `Size` column)


You will need to merge those files for further data manipulations and store the merged file in the `clean_data.csv` file that should contain the following columns:
- `"Store_ID"`
- `"Month"`
- `"Dept"`
- `"IsHoliday"`
- `"Weekly_Sales"`
- `"CPI"`
- "`"Unemployment"`"

After merging and cleaning the data, you will have to analyze monthly sales of Walmart and store the results of your analysis in the `agg_date.csv` file that should look like:

|  Month | Weekly_Sales  | 
|---|---|
| 1.0  |  33174.178494 |
|  2.0 |  34333.326579 |
|  ... | ...  |
